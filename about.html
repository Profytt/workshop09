          I have always enjoyed cooking. Finding new recipies to try and
          different methods always kept me interested in learning more. With my
          work history, I have picked up a multitude of skills I can use every
          day. <br> I love the feeling I get when others enjoy a dish I worked hard
          on. Wheather it's grilling, baking, or sauteing, I'm sure I can make
          something that would put a smile on anyone's face.

       <p class="para">I think my love for tech comes from the fact I was born in the early
        90's. Because of that, I have lived through the tech boom that came in
        that decade. <br> My dad was a person who also had an interest in learning
        about new tech. He captivated me when the Nintendo 64 came out and i
        would always sit and watch him play Star Fox. Or when portable DVD
        players first came out and everyone asked me what it was because no one
        has seen one before. That interest at a young age has always kept me in
        the loop to learn about new applications and devices.

          Music has always been a big part of my life. When I was young, I
          learned to play piano and also played in the school band. Im the band,
          I learned to play all brass intruments as well as some percussion.
          That knowledge at a young age taught me music theory, which helped me
          in my early 20's as I started to produce music. <br />My listening
          taste mostly includes hHip Hop, but i also listen to some R&B, Neo
          Soul, and Lofi for relaxation. I always listen to analyse the music
          and beat selectoin to try to understand the process the producer went
          through to make the track. From samples to producing a song from
          scratch, if a song catches my ear I'll listen to it multiple times in
          a row to try to understand it.
